## usage
 Â As we can see in the example files, you will need to include the JavaScript file jquery.lx-slider.js and the css file jquery.multiscroll.css of the plugin, as well as jQuery. Optionally, you can add the jQuery UI library in case you want to use other easing effects apart from the ones included in the jQuery library which are the linear or swing effects. (easeInQuart is active by default, so you would need jQuery UI library or the customized version which is included in the vendors folder under the name jquery.easings.min.js.)
